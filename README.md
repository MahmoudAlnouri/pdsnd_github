### Project Title
Basic Data Exploration with pandas library in Python on Bikeshare Data in three American cities

### Description
This project focuses on pandas library usage and simple statistics methods to perform descriptive analysis on the bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities - Chicago, Washington, and New York City - to display information such as the most popular days, time or most common stations for starting and ending of trips

The purpose of the project is to help users make decisions about bikes distributions and how to properly provide timely service to customers so they always find bikes in the right locations and the right timeslots to enhance customer satisfaction and increase bike utilization and revenues.

### How to use
You can run the .py file in any code editor, I used VS CODE and Panda Library with Anaconda. You could use similar products or others as you wish

### Possible bugs/issues
Make sure to have loaded the library and data so the program can produce the wanted output

### Files used
- bikeshare.py (This is the python scripts to produce several summary statistics and provide insight to users)
- 3 Files containing the Data in CSV format for the cities of Chicago, Washington DC and New York CIty. 

### Credits
I used many useful resources during this project
- Udacity's Data Science with Python Programming
- Woolbridge Econometrics book, Wiley
